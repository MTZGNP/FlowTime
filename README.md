# ðŸ•’ Flow Time
Flow Time is a modern web application inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, designed to enhance productivity through dynamic rest and focus intervals. Unlike traditional Pomodoro timers with fixed work/rest periods, Flow Time adjusts the rest period based on the duration of the focus session, maintaining a fixed ratio for optimal efficiency and rest.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Dynamic Rest/Focus Times:** Automatic rest periods proportional to focus duration.
- **Customizable Timer:** Adjust focus and rest periods to suit your workflow.
- **Task Management:** Keep track of tasks and focus on what matters.
- **Productivity Reports:** Review your focus and rest periods to optimize your productivity.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI:** Start focusing with just one click.
